* Yew notes
** installation
First to remember yew is cutting edge, web assembly is not production ready yet (please check asm.js status). So 
for now, there's alot things to do with installation process, development environment etc. But why i choose rust and not reasonml, 
purescript, typescript, and other edgy stack we loved? For me, currently i learn rust since i believe rust is very promising. 
others maybe have different reason.

To code rust + yew, there's alot things to do, here's my setup summary:

** Yew
yew is ... no, you can read about yew here. But here's the basic idea. State in yew is define inside model. 

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
// we know this in react as this.state = {}
pub struct Model {
input: i32,
value: i32
}
#+END_SRC


#+BEGIN_SRC rust
// actions
pub enum Msg {
Add,
Substract,
Multiply,
Divide,
Clear,
Calculate
}
#+END_SRC
